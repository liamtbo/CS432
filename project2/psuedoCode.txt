server code

**TODO: need to put in non-blocking code so that i can check time of last join,
and kick servers that haven't sent in 2 min

create linked list of sockaddr_in of adj servers

channel_servers_map = {}
while 1
    // non blocking allows this
    if one minute has passed:
        for each channel this local server is subbed to 
            for each non local-server subbed to channel
                s2s send join channel

    for each channel in channel_servers_map:
        for each server, timestamp on channel
            if curr_time - timestamp > 2:
                remove server from channel

    if recv
        recv(socket)
        ...
        if client join channel or received join channel:
            if server is subbed to channel:
                do nothing
            if server is not subbed to channel
                sub to channel (add channel)
                for every adjacent server
                    channel_servers_map[channel].append((adjserver, timestamp))
                    send s2s join channel
            channel_servers_map[channel].append(src server, timestamp)
            

        if client say or received s2s say channel:
            say to all users on current server
            for every server in channel_servers_map[channel] (except the server that sent s2s say):
                send s2s say to server
            if server has no users on say channel and no other channnels are on channel except for src of s2s say:
                send leave channel to src of s2s say
                leave channel locally

        if s2s server_x leave channel
            channel_servers_map[channel].remove(server_x)
